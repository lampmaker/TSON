2.2         Initial release; untested; parser only.
2.2.1       Added support for indented comments (whitespace before #)
2.2.2       Fixed crash when key has no value (undefined rest parameter)
2.2.3       Added support for indented blocks without braces (table, maptable, matrix, array) - text blocks still require braces
2.2.4       Added TSONCreator class with configurable settings for serialization, structure detection, and formatting
2.2.5       Fixed TSONCreator block type placement - now correctly puts block types directly after colons (key: blocktype)

2.2.7       Fixed array block parsing to support TSON-style objects with unquoted keys and nested arrays
2.2.8       Fixed TSONCreator nested object indentation bug - eliminated extra indentation on tuesday/thursday issue
2.2.9       Added configurable indentation to TSONCreator - supports both spaces and tabs with customizable sizing
