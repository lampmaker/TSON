2.2         Initial release; untested; parser only.
2.2.1       Added support for indented comments (whitespace before #)
2.2.2       Fixed crash when key has no value (undefined rest parameter)
2.2.3       Added support for indented blocks without braces (table, maptable, matrix, array) - text blocks still require braces
